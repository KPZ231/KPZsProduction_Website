      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <hr />
      <p>
        I am a young software and game developer, currently in the third year of
        high school, specializing in programming. My passion for coding began
        when I was 10 years old, and since then, I have continuously developed
        my skills in both software and game development. I am particularly
        interested in creating video games, as they allow me to combine
        creativity with problem-solving in a highly engaging way. I also enjoy
        working on software projects that can make everyday tasks more efficient
        and user-friendly. When it comes to my technical skills, I am proficient
        in several programming languages, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP,
        C#, C++, and SQL. I have a foundational understanding of Python, which I
        am currently exploring further. These skills have allowed me to work on
        various projects, from web development to more complex software and game
        programming. My goal is to continue improving my abilities and exploring
        new technologies to create innovative solutions.
